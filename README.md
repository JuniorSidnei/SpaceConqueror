# TheScavenger
I developed this project with intention to explore my skills and learn more about programming, game design, ui interface and more.

I spent a year developing the project. Programming and drawning everything. 

I've leanerd a lot of stuff with both (Programming and drawing), and a little bit about measuring time in a game production.

I used Unity3D to develop the project using C# as language.

The game is a SpaceShooter, where you have a mission to collect some meteorites to create new weapons for your spaceship. You have your on-board computer to help you at times, also to guide you in the mission.

The code is currently a bit confusing and a little out of place. As I was testing and learning a lot, it stayed that way. Today I know that I can develop a much cleaner and more organized code thanks to the experiences I got from this project.

THIS IS: THE SCAVENGER
